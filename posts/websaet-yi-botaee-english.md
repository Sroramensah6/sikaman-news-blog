Language is the first line of a people's culture and identity. Our uniqueness and beauty as a nation is expressed in our customs and culture, of which our “mother tongue” is central. Right from conception, our mothers spoke to us in soft, beautiful language that nurtured our formation and cognitive abilities as we navigate life's uncertain terrain with desired success. Our mother tongue is the road map of our culture. It tells us where we come from and where we're going.

Radio and Television have played an important role in reporting happenings in our communities and environment in Ghanaian vernacular for some two decades and counting. This is very commendable as it has brought the news that concern the locales to their very understanding and appreciation. The video log media like YouTube have made possible the publication of news [notably, entertainment] in Akan common to find. However, text publications on mainstream news websites and blogs remain in the English language.

[sikamanmedia](/) a brainchild of **Mother Tongue® Media Concepts** brings the news and other happenings to the people in their native language – the Twi mother tongue. This portal will report the news in written Twi vernacular with accompanying audio. It seeks to bring the impact of local commerce (formal and informal) on the people and environment to bare. We aim also to explain and project the many positive customs, tradition, and culture of the people within the geographical and language scope. The main aim is to be a native voice that makes the locales awake to their worth and contributions to the global space while bringing their plight before those to whom mandate has been given to address them.

Our language is the exact reflection of ourselves; therefore, we are making a deliberate move to promote and encourage the reading and writing of the Twi language among indigenes and locales especially the youth. We will publish current local and external information in a simplified form of the language for easy reading and understanding. We are creating a platform for teachers, businesses, custodians of culture and tradition, and the local government authority to inform and account to the people who matter most. They are the true owners of this portal.

As the Nobel laureate, Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, that goes to his head... If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart”. This exactly is the goal [sikamanmedia](/) powered by **Mother Tongue® Media Concepts** seeks to achieve.
